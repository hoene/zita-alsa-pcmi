Zita-alsa-pcmi is the successor of clalsadrv. It provides easy access
to ALSA PCM devices, taking care of the many functions required to
open, initialise and use a hw: device in mmap mode, and providing
floating point audio data. 


Release 0.1.1  (26/01/2012)
---------------------------

* This release is almost API compatible with clalsadrv-2.x.x.
  The only changes your source code will need are:

  - Change the include file.
  - Change the type of any interface objects.
  - Replace calls to stat() by state(). 
  - If you want error reporting on stderr, add an optional
    parameter to the constructor. See include file for details.

* Added support for big-endian PCM formats.

* Added support for reading and writing interleaved user buffers.

* Error messages on stderr can be selectively enabled. If an app
  is compiled without them, they can be re-enabled at runtime by
  defining the environment variable ZITA_ALSA_PCMI_DEBUG, so they
  are now by default off. See source code for details.

* Two simple demo programs are provided, one of them is the ALSA
  version of jack_delay. Complete documentation will follow later.
